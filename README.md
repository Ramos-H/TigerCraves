### About Branches
Modification is prohibited for the following branches:
- `main` - Contains code that should run without errors.
- `dev` - Used as the branch for integrating changes from the `frontend` and `backend` branches as well as resolving any bugs that come as a result of said integration.
- `frontend` - Used as the branch to hold changes related to the user interface of the application, which includes but is not limited to:
  - Layout structure
  - Client-side validation logic
- `backend` - Used as the branch to hold changes related to the business logic with the application, which includes but is not limited to:
  - Database interactions
  - Third-party API interactions

Pulling from these branches, however, is allowed.

If you're assigned a `frontend` task, create a new branch from the `frontend` branch and make your code changes to your newly-created branch.

If you're assigned a `backend` task, create a new branch from the `backend` branch and make your code changes to your newly-created branch.
